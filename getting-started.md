# Getting Started with Jekyll

Welcome to the Jekyll Showcase! This guide will help you get started with Jekyll, a powerful static site generator.

## Installation

To install Jekyll, you need to have Ruby and RubyGems installed on your system. Once you have them, you can install Jekyll by running the following command:

```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Creating a New Site

To create a new Jekyll site, use the following command:

```sh
jekyll new my-awesome-site
```

This will create a new directory called `my-awesome-site` with the default Jekyll files and folders.

## Building and Serving Your Site

To build and serve your Jekyll site locally, navigate to your site's directory and run the following command:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Customizing Your Site

You can customize your Jekyll site by editing the configuration file (`_config.yml`) and adding or modifying content in the various directories (`_posts`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, etc.).

For more information on how to customize your Jekyll site, refer to the official [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
