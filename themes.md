# Jekyll Themes

Jekyll offers a variety of themes to help you quickly style your site. Themes can be used to change the look and feel of your site without having to write custom CSS or HTML.

## Using a Theme

To use a theme in your Jekyll site, you can specify the theme in your `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
theme: minima
```

This will apply the `minima` theme to your site. You can find a list of available themes on the [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/themes/) page.

## Customizing a Theme

You can customize a theme by overriding its files in your Jekyll site. For example, if you want to customize the CSS of a theme, you can create a `_sass` directory in your site and add your custom stylesheets there.

## Creating a Custom Theme

If you want to create your own custom theme, you can do so by creating a new directory for your theme and adding the necessary files (such as `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` directories) to it. You can then specify your custom theme in the `_config.yml` file.

For more information on using and customizing themes, refer to the official [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).
