# Deployment

Deploying your Jekyll site is an important step to make it accessible to the world. Here are some common methods for deploying Jekyll sites:

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a popular and easy way to deploy Jekyll sites. Simply push your Jekyll site to a GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages will automatically build and serve your site.

## Netlify

Netlify is a powerful platform for deploying static sites. It offers continuous deployment, custom domains, and many other features. You can connect your Jekyll site to Netlify and deploy it with a few clicks.

## Vercel

Vercel is another great platform for deploying static sites. It provides a seamless deployment experience and supports custom domains, SSL, and more. You can deploy your Jekyll site to Vercel with ease.

## Other Hosting Providers

You can also deploy your Jekyll site to other hosting providers, such as AWS S3, DigitalOcean, or any web server that supports static files. The deployment process may vary depending on the provider, but the general steps involve building your Jekyll site and uploading the generated files to the server.

For more detailed instructions on deploying your Jekyll site, refer to the official [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/).
