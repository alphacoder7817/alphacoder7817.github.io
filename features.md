# Jekyll Features

Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that offers a wide range of features to help you build and customize your website. Here are some of the key features:

## Front Matter

Jekyll allows you to define metadata for your pages and posts using front matter. This metadata can be used to control the layout, title, and other properties of your content.

## Layouts

With Jekyll, you can create reusable layouts to define the structure of your pages. Layouts help you maintain a consistent look and feel across your site.

## Includes

Jekyll supports includes, which are reusable snippets of code that can be included in your layouts and pages. This allows you to modularize your code and keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Data Files

Jekyll allows you to use data files (in formats like YAML, JSON, and CSV) to store structured data that can be accessed and used in your templates.

## Collections

Collections in Jekyll are custom content types that allow you to group related content together. This is useful for organizing things like portfolios, case studies, or documentation.

## Permalinks

Jekyll provides flexible permalink configurations, allowing you to define custom URL structures for your pages and posts.

## Pagination

Jekyll supports pagination, making it easy to split your content into multiple pages. This is particularly useful for blogs and other content-heavy sites.

## Sass/SCSS

Jekyll has built-in support for Sass and SCSS, allowing you to write your stylesheets using these powerful CSS preprocessors.

## Liquid Templating

Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language, which provides a wide range of features for creating dynamic and customizable templates.

## Assets

Jekyll allows you to manage and include assets (such as images, JavaScript, and CSS files) in your site. This helps you keep your assets organized and easily accessible.
